# Specification Quality Checklist: Rust Performance Optimizations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 14 checklist items pass
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`
- The 12 optimizations from the Rust expert review are mapped to 12 functional requirements
- Performance targets (25% faster, 20% memory reduction) are based on expert estimates
